## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) - For dictionary data
- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - for UI Components
- [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/) - for form validation
- [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/) - for data fetching

### What I learned

- I learned how to use React Hook Form to easily handle Forms data
- I also learned about Tanstack query for data fetching, and how to use it with React Hook Form

### Continued development

I'm getting more and more familiar with using React & TypeScript. Adding types for every variable seems exhausting at first, but it helps a lot in the long run.
During this project, I discovered that I'm still have a long way to learn React, especially it's hooks as they are sometimes confusing and hard to understand.
